# Preview

This preview sets up the sonic environment for the jungle that our two explorers, Wallace and Evelyn, will be going through when they are talking and eventually encounter the T. rex. Right now, there are a few sounds: rain, wind, cicadas, grasshoppers, and a guineafowl (which was part of one of the cicada recordings; I liked it and kept it in). It creates a pretty intense sound when layered altogether, although the grasshopper (which I've simply repeated a few times for now) cuts through quite well to make some distinctions. 

With as many sounds as there are (and are going to be - I'd like to add more bird sounds, leaves rustling, as well as the story-relevant footsteps), the rain and wind sort of become white noise in the background. I think I'm ok with this since the weather is not a critical part of the environment compared to the wildlife. If with too many sources it all gets a bit muddy I might consider phasing in and out certain sounds or have a rotating "spotlight" so that the unique parts of different sounds can be more easily distinguished.

I also do want this intro to be quite loud - a jungle full of life should be loud! However, I will probably fade the background out a good amount before dialogue starts so that it's easily audible. In addition, as the more dramatic parts of the story unfold, the background noise will be minimized or simply silent in order to maintain focus on the dramatic part of the story, and for an auditory break. This is detailed in my script, which is my main document I am working/planning from.

Still to do:
* Finish adding background noises
* Get music
* Record/find bootprint noise
* Record dialogue
* Get T. rex sounds!
* Volume control/fading in and out
* ...
