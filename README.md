## Proposal

My soundscape project, *The King of the Jungle*, will bring listeners to an exotic jungle filled with unfamiliar flora, fauna, and most strikingly, dinosaurs. The soundscape will tell the terrifying tale of two explorers traveling through the jungle when they are caught unawares by the greatest threat of the jungle - *Tyrannosaurus rex*. 

Originally inspired by my campaign of the *Dungeons & Dragons* 5th Edition module *Tomb of Annihilation*, this soundscape cuts back on some of the more D&D-specific lore to produce a more accessible environment for the average listener. A good reference work would be *Jurassic Park*, although there will be no theme park in this setting - just a dangerous, exciting jungle filled with adventure and life. I hope to convey that sense of abundant life in the jungle combined with the drama of a giant dinosaur encounter to break through the noise.
