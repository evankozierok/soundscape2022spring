# Asset List

This list is currently prospective - it will be updated over time.

Note that many of these assets I am unsure if I will record or not - this is at least in part based on Pittsburgh weather patterns. I.e. if I can go record plants rustling I'd like to, but given the snow, that may not be possible.
