# The King of the Jungle

> *Scene: Two explorers, Wallace and Evelyn are walking through a jungle. It is lightly raining and there is a bit of rain rustling leaves. Their boots squelch through mud as they walk, and they push away leaves in their path. In the background, exotic birds are calling and insects and frogs loudly buzz and croak.*

> *After about 10-15 seconds, the loud background fades a bit as dialogue starts.*

To do: develop character and setting. Wallace is knowledgeable and this makes him wary of the jungle and its dangers. Evelyn is perfectly competent to travel in the jungle, but has less experience and curiosity.

EVELYN (speaks with a light, excited voice): I have to say, the biodiversity here is stunning. Do you think we'll actually see any dinosaurs?

WALLACE (speaks with a scholarly voice): I don't know, Evelyn. If we do, I hope its a stegosaurus, triceratops, maybe a diplodocus... any herbivore. I don't need to make any enemies today.

EVELYN: Oh, come on! You can see the herbivores in the museums already. Wouldn't you rather see something you can't see every day?

WALLACE: In theory, yes. In reality, not really.

EVELYN: Wallace, you know most of the stories of people going into the jungle and getting eaten by carnivores are exaggerated. They probably died from much more boring causes, like dehydration or disease.

WALLACE: I'm not sure how that's supposed to make me feel better.

EVELYN: What I'm saying is--

> *As conversation continues, thunderous footsteps are barely audible from behind, growing in volume. They seem to be coming closer.*

WALLACE: Wait, shh! *(They stop moving. In a hushed tone:)* You hear that?

EVELYN *(hushed)*: Mm-hm.

WALLACE: Looks like you're getting what you wished for. We need to get out of here, *now*.

EVELYN: What do you think it is? A tyrannosaurus? 

WALLACE: I don't know, I don't want to know, let's just get out of here, okay?

EVELYN: Come on, I just want to get a quick sketch of it.

> *The large footsteps briefly stop. There is a huge roar, and the footsteps begin again, louder and faster.*

Wallace: Shit! RUN!

> *General chaos. Muddy footsteps and rustling return at a faster pace. Two sets of footsteps are now audible: One from nearby (Evelyn's), and one from her right (Wallace's). The large footsteps become very loud to her right.*

> *Evelyn jumps into a bush, making a rustling noise. Her heartbeat and breathing are audible. To the left: Another huge roar; Wallace screams; sounds of crunching and chewing as the dinosaur gobbles him up.*

EVELYN *(whispered)*: My god... she's so beautiful.

> *After a brief moment, the dinosaur begins to stomp off, and the background noise of the jungle returns.*
