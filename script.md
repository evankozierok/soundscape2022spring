# The King of the Jungle

> *Scene: Two explorers, Wallace and Evelyn, are walking through a jungle. It is lightly raining. Their boots squelch through mud as they walk, and they push away leaves in their path. In the background, exotic birds are calling and insects buzz and chirp. A light drum beat plays under the natural sounds.*

> *After about 10-15 seconds, the loud background fades a bit as dialogue starts, Wallace speaking at Evelyn's right side.*

EVELYN (speaks with a light, excited voice): I have to say, the biodiversity here is stunning. Do you think we'll actually see any dinosaurs?

WALLACE (speaks with a scholarly voice): I don't know, Evelyn. If we do, I hope its a stegosaurus, triceratops, maybe a diplodocus... any herbivore. I don't need to make any enemies today.

EVELYN: Oh, come on! You can see the herbivores in the museums already. Wouldn't you rather see something you can't see every day?

WALLACE: In theory, yes. In reality, not really.

EVELYN: Wallace, you know most of the stories of people going into the jungle and getting eaten by carnivores are exaggerated. They probably died from much more boring causes, like dehydration or disease.

WALLACE: I'm not sure how that's supposed to make me feel better.

EVELYN: What I'm saying is--

> *As conversation continues, thunderous footsteps are barely audible from the right, growing in volume. They seem to be coming closer. The music and jungle sounds fade to silence.*

WALLACE: Wait wait wait wait wait wait, shh! *(They stop moving. In a hushed tone:)* You hear that?

EVELYN *(hushed)*: Mm-hm.

WALLACE: Looks like you're getting what you wished for. We need to get out of here, *now*.

EVELYN: What do you think it is? A tyrannosaurus? 

WALLACE: I don't know, I don't want to know, let's just get out of here, okay?

EVELYN: Come on, I just want to get a quick sketch of it.

> *The large footsteps briefly stop. There is a huge roar that echoes in the jungle.*

Wallace: Shit! RUN!

> *General chaos. The muddy footsteps and leaves rustling return at a faster pace. Two sets of human footsteps are now audible: One from nearby (Evelyn's), and one from her right (Wallace's). Evelyn is breathing heavily. The dinosaur's large footsteps begin again, louder and faster than before. An intense drum beat begins in sync with the rhythm of the dinosaur's booming steps.*

> *Wallace screams as his footsteps stop, the scream echoing. There are sounds of crunching and chewing as the dinosaur gobbles him up.*

EVELYN *(hushed)*: My god... she's so beautiful.

> *After a brief moment, the dinosaur begins to stomp off, and the background noise of the jungle returns.*

> *The background noise fades off. Silence.*
